OFDM-BASED-JOINT-COMMUNICATION-SENSING-SIMULATOR-PYTHONA modular Python framework for simulating OFDM wireless communication pipelines and basic Joint Communication & Sensing (JCS) functionality.
The project implements a full PHY-layer transmit/receive chain, channel models, BER analysis, and radar-style delay estimation using cross-correlation.

This simulator was developed to build hands-on expertise in wireless signal processing, OFDM systems, and HermesPy-style modular DSP architectures.

This project provides a lightweight and extensible simulation environment for:

-Modeling OFDM transceivers

-Testing digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms

-Evaluating wireless channel behavior

-Exploring sensing capabilities embedded within communication signals

-By following a transmitter → channel → receiver pipeline, this project aligns with modern research workflows used in 5G/6G, sensing-integrated communication systems, and PHY-layer prototyping.
